# aslam_clarificationon_sasuri
Following code guides you on how to generate a SAS uri using limited access.

It guides you on how to use and generate SAS uri with limited access like list and write only with "no delete". SAS URI's are effectively the most secured way to access any blob storage content. 

So as someone well said - "Trust none but just your writen code" :) 
Happy Coding !
